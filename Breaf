# Project Overview
This project involves creating a digital dice using an Arduino microcontroller and a 7-segment display. The digital dice simulates the roll of a traditional six-sided die, displaying the result on a 7-segment display when a button is pressed.
Components
•	 Solderless Breadboard: A reusable platform for prototyping electronic circuits without soldering.
•	 Arduino Uno: A microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P, used for building digital devices and interactive objects.
•	7-Segment Display Common Anode: A display device with seven LEDs arranged in a pattern to represent numbers, sharing a common positive terminal.
•	 Push Button: A momentary switch used to input a signal to the Arduino when pressed.
•	100R Resistor: A 100-ohm resistor used to limit current and protect components like LEDs and the display.
•	Buzzer: An audio signaling device that produces sound when activated by an electrical signal.
•	Male to Male Jumper Wires: Wires with pins on both ends for making connections between components on a breadboard.
•	 Battery Clip: A connector used to attach a 9V battery to the circuit.
•	  Battery 9V: A power source providing 9 volts of electrical energy for the project.

Assembly Instructions
Mounting the Components:
·  Place the 7-segment display on the breadboard.
·  Insert the push button into the breadboard.
·  Position the Arduino Uno for easy access to its pins.
·  Insert the buzzer into the breadboard.
Wiring:
·  Connect the 7-Segment Display:
•	Connect the common anode of the display to the 5V pin on the Arduino Uno.
•	Connect each segment pin (a-g) of the 7-segment display to digital pins 2 to 8 on the Arduino Uno through 100-ohm resistors to limit the current.
o	Pin a: Digital Pin 2
o	Pin b: Digital Pin 3
o	Pin c: Digital Pin 4
o	Pin d: Digital Pin 5
o	Pin e: Digital Pin 6
o	Pin f: Digital Pin 7
o	Pin g: Digital Pin 8
·  Push Button:
•	One terminal to Digital Pin 9.
•	Other terminal to GND.
•	10k ohm pull-down resistor between Digital Pin 9 and GND.
Buzzer:
•	Positive terminal to Digital Pin 10
•	Negative terminal to GND.
Power Connections:
•	GND pins of the Arduino to the ground rail.
•	5V pin of the Arduino to the positive rail.
Power Supply
Connect the Battery:
•	Attach the battery clip to a 9V battery.
•	Connect the positive wire of the battery clip to the VIN pin on the Arduino Uno.
•	Connect the negative wire of the battery clip to one of the GND pins on the Arduino Uno.

Usage
•	Press the push button to simulate rolling a dice.
•	The Arduino generates a random number between 1 and 6.
•	The result is displayed on the 7-segment display.
•	The buzzer sounds briefly to indicate the dice roll.
•	This setup mimics rolling a physical dice, useful for digital games and educational purposes.
Troubleshooting
Display does not show numbers:
•	Check the connections between the Arduino Uno and the 7-segment display.
•	Ensure the resistors are correctly connected to each segment.
•	Verify that the common anode is properly connected to the 5V pin.
Button press not registering:
•	Confirm the push button connections, ensuring one terminal is connected to digital pin 9 and the other to GND.
•	Check the 10k ohm pull-down resistor between digital pin 9 and GND.
•	Test the button with a multimeter to ensure it is functioning correctly.
Buzzer does not sound:
•	Verify the connections of the buzzer, ensuring the positive terminal is connected to digital pin 10 and the negative terminal to GND.
•	Check the code to ensure the buzzer is triggered correctly.
Random number generation seems incorrect:
•	Ensure the randomSeed() function is used correctly in the setup() function.
•	Verify the analogRead() function is used to provide a good random seed.
